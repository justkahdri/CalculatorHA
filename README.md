# Project CalculatorHA
Just a place to post my personal projects

For now is just a project about Concrete Structures.
The purpose is the automation of diverse Math problems.
[Published here](https://justkahdri.github.io/CalculatorHA/)

## Columns
  You put the weight distribution that holds the column, floors' quantity, the concrete quality and done!
  + Glossary
      W = weight in KN
      H = HºAº quality
      Ag = Column minimum section
      Cx and Cy = widths in X axis and Y axis

## Beams
  The rules are simple, the concrete beam's shouldn't be longer than 7 meters. With this information the code returns the most suitable measures for it.
  + Glossary
      h = height
      bw = width
      d = distance between the edge and the steel bars
      
## Slabs
  Slabs can have steel bars in one or both directions and that depends of his lengh and width (one-direction < 2 <= both-directions)
  + Glossary
      x = width
      y = lenght
      h = height
      β = widht-lenght relation

## Concrete Wall
   + Glossary
      W = weight in KN
      H = HºAº quality
      Ag = Column minimum section
      e = width
      p = perimeter
      
## Bugs known
  - There is an image of a slab fixed on the website
