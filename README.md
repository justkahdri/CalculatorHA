# Project-J5
Just a place to post my personal projects

For now is just a project about HºAº Structures.
The purpose is the automation of diverse Math problems.

## Columns
  You put the weight distribution that holds the column, floors' quantity, the HºAº quality and done!
  + Glossary
      W = weight in KN
      H = HºAº quality
      Ag = Column minimum section
      Cx and Cy = widths in X axis and Y axis

## Beams
  The rules are simple, the concrete beam's shouldn't be longer than 7 meters. With this information the code returns the most suitable measures for it.
  + Glossary
      h = height
      bw = width
      d = distance between the edge and the steel bars

## Bugs known
  - The copy function doesn't work too well in the Columns section
